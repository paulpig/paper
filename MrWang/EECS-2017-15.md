challenge：

1. Design AI systems that learn continually by interacting with a dynamic environment, while making decisions that aretimely, robust, and secure(能够持续学习，做出及时的反应)
2. Design AI systems that enable personalized applications and services yet do not compromise users’ privacy and security(个人而言)
3. Design AI systems that can train on datasets owned
by di!erent organizations without compromising their con"dentiality,and in the process provide AI capabilities that span the boundaries ofpotentially competing organization(数据的保密，数据被盗用，对于企业而言)
4. Develop domain-specific architectures and software
systems to address the performance needs of future AI applications in the post-Moore’s Law era, including custom chips for AI workloads, edge-cloud systems to e#ciently process data at the edge, and techniques for abstracting and sampling data.（数据的处理）
